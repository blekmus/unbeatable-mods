# UNBEATABLE MODS

MelonLoader mods for UNBEATABLE

## Custom Playlist

Adds a custom playlist feature to Arcade Mode.

### Features

Adds a new **playlist** category in the filters menu that works with all existing sorting methods.

Press `F3` to toggle songs in and out of the playlist.

The playlist is saved alongside your save files and syncs to Steam Cloud. It's stored in its own file, so if the game updates and breaks the mod, your save file won't get corrupted.
